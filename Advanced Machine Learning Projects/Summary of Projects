Project 1 - Bayesian Networks - Implementing Basyesian Networks to predict disease risk. 
Our Grade was 16. 
From the professor notes she said we could of gone deeper in the exploratory data analysis and the discussion of results. Also we had some mistakes in the training and finding the best model.
Nonetheless very good project and helped us deepen our knowledge in Probabilistic Graphical Models.
