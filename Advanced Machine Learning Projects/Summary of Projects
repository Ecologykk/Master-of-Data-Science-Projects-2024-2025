# Project 1 - Bayesian Networks - Implementing Basyesian Networks to predict disease risk. 
Our Grade was 16. 
From the professor notes she said we could of gone deeper in the exploratory data analysis and the discussion of results. Also we had some mistakes in the training and finding the best model.
Nonetheless very good project and helped us deepen our knowledge in Probabilistic Graphical Models.


#Project 2 - (Deep) Reinforcement Learning- Implementing Q learning, Deep Q learning and Soft Actor Critic to solve Mountain Car problem.
Our grade was 16.
Once again from the professor notes, she said it was generally good yet we could of explored more expecially in the Soft Actor Critic model.
Deep Reinforcement Learning is not a easy field, but it was good getting our feet wet in this state of the art techniques and technology.
