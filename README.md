## 🏆 1st Year, 1st Semester

### 📊 Multivariate Data Analysis  - Grade: **16**  
A nice course, but a bit rushed since it covered a lot of topics in a short time. The practical part in R was sufficient to learn, though.  

### 🤖 Machine Learning  - Grade: **18**  
One of the flagship mandatory courses. I already had some background knowledge on some of the theory, so that helped. My only complaint is that, as a standalone course, it’s not enough to truly grasp what machine learning is.  

### 🔬 Advanced Machine Learning  - Grade: **16**  
This one went deep into more complex statistical models like Bayesian Networks, HMMs, and even Reinforcement Learning. It was truly advanced, dealing with all the complex math and stats involved, but it helped me gain a deeper understanding of how some state-of-the-art models work under the hood—like LLMs and the newer reasoning models using deep reinforcement learning.  

### 📈 Foundations of Data Science  - Grade: **19**  
Top of the class! I really enjoyed this course. It covered the fundamental concepts of data science, including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling. The hands-on assignments were great, and it was a well-structured introduction to the field. Also my essay about the ethical dilemas in Data Science earned me a 20/20 grade. It was extremely fun to research on that topic and I learned a lot.  

### 🗄️ Database Technologies / Advanced Databases  - Grade: **18**  
A solid course covering both traditional relational databases and more advanced NoSQL and distributed database systems. The practical work was engaging, and I really liked the focus on scalability and real-world applications.  

### 🎤 Seminars in Data Science  - Grade: **20**  
Top of the class again! This course consisted of various guest lectures and presentations on different topics in data science. Some seminars were really interesting, while others felt a bit generic. Overall, a decent course that enabled to grasp different visions from the Data Science domain.

## 🏆 1st Year, 2nd Semester

### 🧠 Deep Learning  - Grade: **17**  
Another nuclear course where we explored neural networks in detail — CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and more. I especially liked experimenting with PyTorch and seeing how these models actually learn under the hood. Definitely one of my favorites this semester.  

### ☁️ Cloud Computing  - Grade: **12**  
Honestly, not my best course but probably the most rewarding. This 12 is worth more than some 18+ grades I had. I say this cause I had no background in this software development part. The concepts were very important for future endeavors (mainly focused on cloud architectures, Docker, and Kubernetes), but the workload was heavy and the evaluation method didn’t really click with me(100% project based, which lacked some theoretical nuance). Still, I got to learn some useful stuff about deployment and scalability.  

### 📊 Bayesian Statistics  - Grade: **13**  
This one was tough cause it was 100% theoretical with no practical applications or even basic implementations.  I understood the basics and the intuition behind it, but it wasn’t my strongest subject. It’s definitely an area I want to revisit with more time.  

### 🔗 Information Integration and Analytical Processing  - Grade: **16**  
A very hands-on course focused on data pipelines, ETL processes, and big data tools. I enjoyed the practical aspect and how it tied together many things we learned in other courses. Solid course overall focusing on what 80% of a Data Scientist actually is ahaha.

### 🔍 Data Mining  - Grade: **15**  
Covered classic data mining technique, namely association rules, and more at a surface level in clustering and anomaly detection due to professor health issues during the semester. It was quite interesting, and the projects helped put theory into practice. Some topics overlapped a bit with Machine Learning, but still useful for understanding different approaches to data exploration.
