## 🏆 1st Year, 1st Semester

### 📊 Multivariate Data Analysis (Análise de Dados Multivariados) - Grade: **16**  
A nice course, but a bit rushed since it covered a lot of topics in a short time. The practical part in R was sufficient to learn, though.  

### 🤖 Machine Learning (Aprendizagem Automática) - Grade: **18**  
One of the flagship mandatory courses. I already had some background knowledge on some of the theory, so that helped. My only complaint is that, as a standalone course, it’s not enough to truly grasp what machine learning is.  

### 🔬 Advanced Machine Learning (Aprendizagem Automática Avançada) - Grade: **16**  
This one went deep into more complex statistical models like Bayesian Networks, HMMs, and even Reinforcement Learning. It was truly advanced, dealing with all the complex math and stats involved, but it helped me gain a deeper understanding of how some state-of-the-art models work under the hood—like LLMs and the newer reasoning models using deep reinforcement learning.  

### 📈 Foundations of Data Science (Fundamentos de Ciência de Dados) - Grade: **19**  
Top of the class! I really enjoyed this course. It covered the fundamental concepts of data science, including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling. The hands-on assignments were great, and it was a well-structured introduction to the field. Also my essay about the ethical dilemas in Data Science earned me a 20/20 grade. It was extremely fun to research on that topic and I learned a lot.  

### 🗄️ Database Technologies / Advanced Databases (Tecnologias de Base de Dados / Bases de Dados Avançadas) - Grade: **18**  
A solid course covering both traditional relational databases and more advanced NoSQL and distributed database systems. The practical work was engaging, and I really liked the focus on scalability and real-world applications.  

### 🎤 Seminars in Data Science (Seminários em Ciência de Dados) - Grade: **19**  
This course consisted of various guest lectures and presentations on different topics in data science. Some seminars were really interesting, while others felt a bit generic. Overall, a decent course that enabled to grasp different visions from the Data Science domain.
